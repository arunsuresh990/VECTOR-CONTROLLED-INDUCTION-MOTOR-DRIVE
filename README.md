Vector controlled 3 level VSI â€“fed
IM can be used for the rotor side control of IM, which is more beneficial than its
preceders. Rotor side control of IM permits the control of voltage, current, active
power and reactive power. In the proposed scheme the rotor is fed through a 3
level VSI which gets its switching pulses by SPWM technique. Direct vector
control method is adopted and rotor and stator parameters are converted from
rotating reference frame to synchronous reference frame which provide precise
independent control of both the active and reactive power which is to be studied.
By this technique it is possible to operate the IM in 4 quadrants -sub synchronous
&amp; super synchronous generating and sub synchronous &amp; super synchronous
motoring. This method finds its application where an IM is to be operated as a
generator supplying power to the grid. The simulated response of an induction
motor will be presented in different modes of operation.
